Helix Calc is a simple Reverse Polish Notation calculator.

It's written in #rust, using #ratatui for the cross-platform interface.

The name is inspired by [Helix Editor](https://helix-editor.com/), and the
functionality by the venerable GNU dc.

This is a toy app that fulfills my personal needs, but I'm open to PR :)
